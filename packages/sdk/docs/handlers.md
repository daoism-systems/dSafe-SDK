## handleCreateTransaction

This function in the dSafe SDK creates blockchain transactions, interfacing with ComposeDB to handle transaction data for decentralized finance (DeFi) operations. It involves verifying safe existence, gathering transaction data from external APIs, and orchestrating transaction and related entity creation in ComposeDB.

### Operations and Logic

1. **Payload Validation:** Validates payload for required information including `safe` address and network.
2. **Safe Existence Check:** Verifies if the safe exists in ComposeDB; if not, creates a new entry using data from an external API.
3. **Safe Data Composition:** Constructs a new safe entity in ComposeDB with details like network ID and safe address.
4. **Signer Validation and Creation:** Ensures transaction initiator exists in ComposeDB; if absent, creates a new signer entity.
5. **Transaction Creation:** Forms the transaction entity with details such as hash, recipient, and nonce.
6. **Transaction Confirmation:** Creates a confirmation entity for each transaction, linking it to its signer.
7. **Idempotency and Error Handling:** Checks for existing transactions with the specified nonce to avoid duplication.

### ComposeDB Interactions

Engages with ComposeDB to manage data related to transactions, safes, signers, and confirmations, using utility functions for checking safe existence, composing safes and signers, and more.

## handleUpdateConfirmations

Updates the confirmation status of transactions within ComposeDB, essential for multisig transaction workflows. It adds confirmation to a transaction by a signer, reflecting decentralized governance.

### Overview and Operations

1. **Validation and Transaction Existence Check:** Validates payload and ensures the transaction exists in ComposeDB.
2. **Fetching Transaction and Safe Information:** Retrieves transaction details from ComposeDB using provided identifiers.
3. **Signer Verification and Creation:** Confirms or creates a signer entity in ComposeDB if not present.
4. **Adding Confirmation to Transaction:** Links a confirmation entity to the transaction in ComposeDB.
5. **Confirmation Creation Check:** Verifies the successful creation of confirmation in ComposeDB.

### ComposeDB Interactions

Involves extensive interactions with ComposeDB for managing transaction confirmations, including checking transactions and signers, and adding confirmations.

## handleGetSafe

Retrieves detailed information about a safe from ComposeDB. It's critical for accessing safe properties, configuration, and transaction history.

### Operations

1. **Payload Validation:** Checks if a safe address is provided.
2. **Fetching Safe Data:** Uses the `getSafe` utility function to retrieve safe data from ComposeDB.
3. **Data Retrieval and Response:** Formats and returns the retrieved safe data.

### ComposeDB Interaction

Primarily uses the `getSafe` utility function for querying ComposeDB, ensuring direct access to safe information.

## handleGetAllTransactions

Fetches all transactions associated with a specific safe from ComposeDB, supporting auditing, monitoring, and display of transactions.

### Operations

1. **Network Identification and Payload Validation:** Determines network ID and validates safe address.
2. **Safe Existence Check:** Verifies safe existence in ComposeDB.
3. **Fetching Transactions:** Retrieves transactions associated with the safe's ID from ComposeDB.
4. **Formatting Response Data:** Structures the retrieved transactions for application use.

### ComposeDB Interaction

Utilizes utility functions like `checkSafeExists` and `getAllTransactions` for efficient data retrieval.

## handleGetTransaction

Fetches detailed information about a specific transaction using its hash, essential for verifying, displaying, or auditing transaction details.

### Operations

1. **Network Identification and Payload Validation:** Identifies network and validates transaction hash.
2. **Fetching Transaction Data:** Retrieves transaction details from ComposeDB.
3. **Return Transaction Data:** Formats and returns the transaction data.

### ComposeDB Interaction

Centers around the `getTransaction` utility function for querying transaction details based on hash.

## handleGetTransactionConfirmations

Retrieves all confirmations for a specified transaction, vital for multisig transaction management and approval status monitoring.

### Operations

1. **Network Identification and Payload Validation:** Confirms network ID and validates transaction hash.
2. **Fetching Confirmation Data:** Queries ComposeDB for transaction confirmations.
3. **Formatting and Returning Data:** Structures and returns the confirmation details.

### ComposeDB Interaction

Depends on the `getTransactionConfirmations` utility function for fetching confirmation data from ComposeDB.

## handleUpdateDelegates

Manages delegate permissions for a safe, allowing for the addition or updating of delegate permissions through ComposeDB interactions.

### Operations

1. **Payload and Network Validation:** Validates delegate and safe addresses and identifies the network.
2. **Safe and Delegate Existence Check:** Confirms the existence of the safe and delegate in ComposeDB.
3. **Delegate Creation or Update:** Adds or updates delegate information in ComposeDB.
4. **Response and Status Code Generation:** Outputs the

 operation's success or failure.

### ComposeDB Interaction

Involves verifying safe and delegate existence and updating delegate information in ComposeDB.

## handleGetDelegates

Retrieves all delegates associated with a safe, supporting access and permission management within the safe's ecosystem.

### Operations

1. **Payload Validation and Safe Existence Check:** Validates safe address and confirms safe existence in ComposeDB.
2. **Fetching Delegate Data:** Queries ComposeDB for delegate information.
3. **Formatting and Returning Data:** Returns the delegate data.

### ComposeDB Interaction

Utilizes `checkSafeExists` and `getDelegate` utility functions for accurate delegate data retrieval.

## handleGetOwnersSafes

Retrieves all safes associated with an owner's address, offering a consolidated view of ownership.

### Operations

- Validates payload, fetches owner's safes from ComposeDB, and returns safes data.

### ComposeDB Interaction

Directly queries ComposeDB using the `getOwnersSafes` utility function to fetch associated safes.

## handleMarkTransactionExecuted

Marks a transaction as executed, updating its status in the decentralized ledger maintained in ComposeDB.

### Operations

- Validates payload, fetches and updates transaction data in ComposeDB, and returns update status.

### ComposeDB Interaction

Engages with `getTransaction` and `updateTransaction` utility functions for fetching and updating transaction records.
