API Endpoint: `APIENDPOINT`

## User story
I want to interact with dSafe for the API Endpoint.

## Status Quo
Currently no handler exist for the endpoint.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User should be able to make use of dSafe without using new function. They should be able to make use of existing implementation.
- [ ] 100% Test Coverage
